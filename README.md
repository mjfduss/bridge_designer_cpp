# West Point Bridge Design Contest (WPBDC) web site

This is a Rails reimplementation of the 1998 vintage perl code for
the [*West Point Bridge Design Contest*] web site
by [Gene Ressler](http://www.eecs.usma.edu). The new code runs as the [*Engineering
Encounters Bridge Contest*](http://bridgecontest.org).
